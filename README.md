# Nerdy Version of Wordle ‚Äì Nerdle _(Abandoned Project)_

This was an early attempt to create a fun & educational version of the game **Wordle** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It served as a learning project to explore basic JavaScript logic, game design, and DOM manipulation.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This project is currently **unfinished and no longer maintained**, as I'm focusing on newer JavaScript projects for my **UX course (Summer 2025 semester).**

üëâ To see a more recent and complete project, check out my [Word Morph project](https://github.com/MariellaAzar/devoir3_wordmorph) or [UX/UI Portfolio](https://github.com/MariellaAzar/SEG3525_Portfolio).

Thanks for stopping by! :)
